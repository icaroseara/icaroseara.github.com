Hello Everyone!

I just decided to start posting in my own tech blog. 

This is an opportunity to share my experience on being a software developer and some discoveries in my journey to improve myself.

I decided using Hugo in my blog  because this was proved as a simple, portable, flexible and really fast solution.

In a few minutes, I have responsible blog, with a clean layout.

So, Hugo is awesome!

I strongly recommend take a look at http://gohugo.io/.
